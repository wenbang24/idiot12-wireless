## 22 May 2025 - Keymap
Initial draft of the alpha layer (note: will probably not use qwerty because most frequently used letters should only require one keypress)

Explanation:
- Press Q for Q
- Press Q and Z for A
- Press Q, E, Z, and C for S
(a bit of a weird system but its kinda cool)
Time spent: 30 mins
