## 22 May 2025 - Keymap
Initial draft of the alpha layer (note: will probably not use qwerty because most frequently used letters should only require one keypress)

Explanation:
- Press Q for Q
- Press Q and Z for A
- Press Q, E, Z, and C for S
(a bit of a weird system but its kinda cool)
Time spent: 30 mins

## 24 May 2025 - Schematic
1st draft of the schematic - hoping it doesn't blow up :)
Time spent: 3 hrs

2nd draft - removed some unnecessary voltage sensing circuitry
Time spent: 1 hr

## 29 May 2025 - PCB Routing
Someone on Slack has told me that my schematic is ok :)
Removed the really expensive debug connector and replaced it with a normal 6 pin ICSP header
Also routed the PCB
Time spent: 4.5 hrs
